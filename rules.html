        Welcome! Here are some reverse-engineering challenges I've made on my spare time. I hope you'll enjoy them.
        New challenges will be irregularly uploaded. Thanks for @0x6D6172636F for his artworks!
        
        The rules are simple:
        - All challenges are available, you don't have to solve the first to access others.
        - For the scoreboard, you'll need to write WriteUps for challenges you solve. Send them at <mark class="text">s01den@protonmail.com</mark>. 
        Points will be attributed according to their quality and the speed at which you provided them 
        (If you are the first to solve a challenge, you'll earn more points).
        - I love ELFs! You might enjoy <a href="https://tmpout.sh">tmp.0ut</a>, this could help you!  
        - That's all, have fun!
